## Cloud-Init

### Cloud-Init

__Cloud-Init__ is the industry-standard tool for initializing cloud instances across platforms, supporting all major public cloud providers and provisioning systems for cloud infrastructure setups. During boot, it detects its environment and configures the system accordingly. On first boot, instances are automatically set up with networking, storage, SSH keys, packages, and other configurations, ensuring they're ready for use immediately.

__User Data__ enables configurations to be applied after a cloud instance has booted. You can utilize either distribution-specific scripting languages (such as bash or PowerShell) or the distribution-independent method of cloud-config. For example, you might want to automate the installation of the Nginx web server immediately after the cloud instance completes its boot sequence.

For example, you might want to automate the installation of the Nginx web server immediately after the cloud instance completes its boot sequence.

### Simple Example

* Installing the webs server
* Starting the webserver

#### Distribution-Specific

```shell
#!/bin/bash

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade –y
sudo apt-get install –y nginx
sudo systemctl start nginx
```
This example is specific for a Linux distribution.

#### Distribution-Independent

```json
#cloud-config

package_upgrade: true
packages: 
   - nginx
runcmd:
   - systemctl start nginx
```
This example is independent and works cross-platforms. 

### Complex Example

* Set-up and configure web server.
* Download the application from an SOS bucket using a pre-signed key.
* Install the application.
* Launch the application.

```
#cloud-config
package_upgrade: true
packages:
  - nginx
  - nodejs
  - npm
write_files:
  - owner: www-data:www-data
    path: /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
    content: |
      server {

## Automation

### Automation

Exoscale empowers seamless cloud infrastructure automation with APIs, CLI tools, and Infrastructure as Code, enabling efficient deployment, management, and scaling of resources with control, speed, and consistency.

Elevate `cloud-init` by incorporating:

* `CLI`: Command Line Interface
* `API`: Application Programming Interface
* `IaC`: Infrastructure as Code

### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

`IaC` employs machine-readable definition files to manage and provision data centers, eliminating the need for physical hardware or manual configurations.

* Define entire infrastructure as code
* Automate infrastructure management
* Rapidly launch, alter, or remove infrastructure
* Code serves as documentation

Exoscale offers a __Terraform Plugin__ to support this model.

By focusing on __immutable infrastructure__, this approach emphasizes __replacement over updates__.

#### Example

```
data "exoscale_compute_template" "ubuntu" {
  zone = local.zone
  name = "Linux Ubuntu 24.04 LTS 64-bit"
}

resource "exoscale_security_group" "web" {
  name = "web"
}

resource "exoscale_compute_instance" ”webserver" {
  zone               = local.zone
  name               = "webserver"
  type               = "standard.medium"
  template_id        = data.exoscale_compute_template.ubuntu.id
  disk_size          = 10
  security_group_ids = [
    data.exoscale_security_group.default.id, 
    exoscale_security_group.web.id,
  ]
  user_data          = <<EOF
#cloud-config

package_upgrade: true
packages:
  - nginx
write_files:
  - owner: www-data:www-data
    path: /var/www/html/index.html
    content: |
      Hello world!
runcmd:
  - systemctl restart nginx
EOF
}
```

A simple example of `IaC` usage in a Terraform script.


### Application Programming Interface (API)

Access all Exoscale functionalities through the `Exoscale API`:

<a href="https://community.exoscale.com/reference/api/" target="_blank">__https://community.exoscale.com/reference/api/__</a>


* Unlock automation's full potential
* Compatible with any programming language
* Restrict access precisely using IAM

#### Example

## Scaling

### Scaling

Exoscale supports efficient vertical and horizontal scaling, featuring automatable Instance Pools for quick group resizing. Easily adjust resources to match demand, ensuring high availability and streamlined cloud operations.

The Exoscale Platform provides two ways of scaling:

* __Vertical__ (scale up)
* __Horizontal__ (scale out)

Which way should be used also depends on your app's architecture, and there is an impact on the operational procedures as well.

![](scaling_v+h.png "Vertical and Horizontal Scaling")


#### Vertical

Adjustments can be made at any time while the __instance__ is __stopped__. Billing is calculated by the second.

![](scaling_v.png "Vertical Scaling")


#### Horizontal

Make changes any time __without stopping__ the __instance__. Billing is calculated by the second.

![](scaling_h.png "Horizontal Scaling")


### Instance Pools

Group multiple compute instances with identical configurations:

* Seamlessly adjust the number of instances in a Pool
  * Increase: Automatically boots a new instance with identical parameters. 
  * Decrease: Removes the oldest VM, allowing for pool cycling.
* Commonly paired with cloud-init for application provisioning.

![](my-instance-pool.png "User Interface Instance Pool")

#### Automation

* Scale up or down via Exoscale API or CLI commands.
* Fully automatable with Kubernetes right out of the box.

![](pool-web-server.png "User Interface Pool Web Server")

## Traffic

### Traffic

Exoscale optimizes cloud traffic with free internal and incoming data, plus an outgoing traffic free tier per instance. Benefit from cost-effective, high-performance connectivity and transparent data usage across your cloud services.

Is the exchange of data between computers, is vital in cloud computing from two perspectives:

* __Performance:__ Includes throughput and latency
* __Cost:__ Encompasses data volume and timeframe

_Let's examine this aspect._


### Internal Traffic
__Internal traffic is free of charge!__

* Exoscale services within a zone
* Exoscale services across zones

![](traffic-internal.png "Internal Traffic")


### Incoming Traffic
Traffic coming from the internet is free of charge!

![](traffic-incoming.png "Incoming Traffic")


### Outgoing Traffic
Traffic towards the Internet is billed.
BUT, it comes with a free tier at Exoscale:

* 1.42 GB per instance in the period of one hour
* Free traffic is shared in the organization
* Free traffic is only available in the hour created

![](traffic-outgoing.png "Outgoing Traffic")


### Traffic Examples
Two examples to illustrate the free tier and the billing aspects:

* Instance A and B
  * A creates 2 GB of outgoing traffic
  * B creates 0.5 GB of outgoing traffic
  * Completely under free tier, as both together have 2.84 of free traffic
* Instance A exist inside one hour
  * A creates 2 GB of outgoing traffic
  * 1.42 GB are free, 580 MB are to be paid

![](traffic-example.png "Example")

#### VIDEO
[Traffic](https://sos-de-fra-1.exo.io/exoscale-academy/videos/csa-basics-07.mp4)

## Storage

### Storage

Exoscale delivers secure, scalable cloud storage with S3-compatible Object Storage, high-performance Block Storage, and fast local NVMe—all easy to manage, cost-efficient, and ideal for backups, apps, and high-demand workloads.

### Object Storage

Simple Object Storage (SOS) is an S3-compatible solution for storing assets, files, and metadata. It offers a cost-effective way to support your applications, back up data, or serve files from any Exoscale zone—without hidden fees. SOS works seamlessly with existing S3-compatible tools and APIs, providing a familiar and reliable experience.

![](sos.png "Simple Object Storage Overview")

* Easy to use - Quick setup and seamless S3 integration.
* Highly available - Each object is replicated across three copies  
* Configurable file URLs - Manage access with ACLs (Access Control Lists)

ACLs (Access Control Lists) permission control:

* __private__- accessible only with an API key  
* __public-read__- anyone can read  
* __public-read-write__- anyone can read and write !!!
* __manual edit__- assign specific permissions to other organizations

#### Encryption – Purpose and Scope

SOS Encryption protects stored data from physical theft, unauthorized access, and meets compliance requirements.
Data is encrypted at the smallest shareable unit (Inode), enabling efficient range access and secure copy operations.

__Benefits__

* Strong Security: Minimal plaintext exposure; only root keys require strict protection. Compromise of one key has limited impact.
* Performance: Bulk encryption is handled by application instances, reducing load on central key management systems. Hardware acceleration (AES-NI) ensures high throughput.
* Compliance & Integrity: Meets regulatory requirements and provides tamper-evidence for both data and metadata.
* Flexibility & Scalability: Per-bucket keys allow for segmented protection and flexible encryption policies.

#### Encryption – Implementation

__Key Hierarchy__

Uses a layered key structure:

* Inode Data Encryption Key (DEK)
* Object Key Encryption Key (KEK)
* Bucket Key
* Root Key (master, protected in Vault)

__Data Model Changes__

Keys are stored in metadata, with additional columns added for tracking encryption keys at various levels.

__Algorithm__

Employs DAREv2 for packetized encryption and AES-GCM (AEAD) for authenticated encryption and tamper detection 256bit strong.

__Operational Features__

Supports key rotation, bucket-level encryption enable/disable, and provides query interfaces for key management.

## Backup

### Backup

Exoscale supports flexible backup strategies, from full VM snapshots to incremental agent-based backups in S3. Restore files or entire systems easily, and choose the best-fit solution for your data protection needs—no vendor lock-in. Backup practices have been in place long before the advent of cloud services, and organizations often rely on their own preferred methods. Exoscale does not enforce a specific backup solution, allowing users the flexibility to choose from multiple supported options.


### Snapshots

#### Full VM snapshots

* Simple to implement and automate  
* Enables easy full restores  
* Quickly create templates from snapshots  

#### Limitations

* Partial restores are not supported  
* Always snapshots the entire disk, leading to higher storage usage and costs  
* Snapshots are deleted when the VM is removed  
* May be inconsistent—database recovery is not always guaranteed

![](snapshots_ui.png "Snapshots UI")


### Agent Based Backup

__Backup the filesystem directly to an S3 bucket__

* Incremental
* Partial restores
* Great flexibility
* Economical 
* Harder to implement -> Requires a third-party application

![](backup-1.png "Backup")


### Agent Based Restore - Option A

Restore the filesystem directly from an S3 bucket.

![](backup-2.png "Restore - Option A")


### Agent Based Restore - Option B

Restore the whole system from an S3 bucket.

![](backup-3.png "Restore - Option B")

## Networking

### Networking

Exoscale demystifies cloud networking by breaking it into practical parts -- switching, routing, load balancing, and private networks -- making secure, scalable connectivity intuitive and manageable for every cloud user.

![](network.png "Network Example")

### Network Layer Model
Throughout, we’ll reference the network layer model and align each topic accordingly.

![](network-layers.png "Network Layer Model")

Next, we’ll explore and clarify the following areas:

* Switching/Routing
* Load Balancing 
* Private Networks


#### VIDEO
[Networking](https://sos-de-fra-1.exo.io/exoscale-academy/videos/csa-networks-01.mp4)


## Switching/Routing

### Switching/Routing

Exoscale distinguishes local Layer 2 switching with MAC addresses from global Layer 3 routing with IPs, enabling flexible, efficient network segmentation and seamless connectivity within and across cloud environments.

#### Layer 2 - Switching

* Operates using MAC addresses (_unique to each device_)
* Handles traffic within local or private networks
* Managed by switches
* Example MAC address: `f8:4d:89:84:eb:8e`

#### Layer 3 - Routing

* Uses IP Addresses
* For traffic and routing in a global manner
* Done by routers
* Example IP address: `10.55.22.1/32


### Local Network

* Switches operate at Layer 2, using only MAC addresses—not IP addresses  
* Devices on the same local network and subnet can communicate directly

![](switching.png "Switching Subnets")

### IP Addresses

#### A subnet for one IP address
![](subnet-32.png "Subnet 32")

#### A subnet for two IP addresses
![](subnet-31.png "Subnet 31")

#### A subnet for 256 IP addresses
![](subnet-24.png "Subnet 24")

#### Subnets 
![](subnets.png "Subnet Examples")


### Routing Subnets

Communication between different subnets requires a router (gateway).
The gateway IP must be specified and is typically within the same subnet.

![](routing.png "Routing Subnets")


#### VIDEO
[Networking](https://sos-de-fra-1.exo.io/exoscale-academy/videos/csa-networks-02.mp4)

## Private Network

### Private Network

Exoscale Private Networks enable secure, isolated Layer 2 connectivity for instances in the same zone, with customizable IPs, granular DHCP, and flexible gateway options for advanced cloud networking and seamless app integration.

* Local network between instances within the same zone  
* Private networks can be created freely  
* No Security Groups between instances  
* Operates at Layer 2—like a switch connecting all instances  
* Private IP addresses/subnets can be chosen from reserved ranges  
* IPs must be configured via SSH/RDP or Cloud-Init  
* Managed Private Networks can assign IPs automatically via DHCP

__Reserved Subnets__ - can be used for private networks:

* `10.0.0.0/8`
* `172.16.0.0/12`
* `192.168.0.0/16`

### Granular DHCP Support via the CLI
Exoscale's Managed Private Networks support granular DHCP configurations, providing enhanced control over network settings through the CLI.

- [DHCP Option 3] Default Gateway (Router): Sets the IP of the default gateway for external traffic.
- [DHCP Option 6] DNS Servers: Specifies DNS server IPs for domain name resolution.
- [DHCP Option 42] NTP Servers: Defines IPs for time synchronization with NTP servers.
- [DHCP Option 119] Domain Search List: Supplies a list of domain suffixes supporting multi-domain environments (limited to 255 octets).


### Gateway Considerations

#### A gateway is needed for
* Connecting private networks across zones  
* Linking private networks to company networks or the internet  
* Interconnecting multiple private networks

#### A gateway can be implemented using
* Ubuntu instances with routing configuration  
* VyOS router templates


#### VIDEO
[Private Network](https://sos-de-fra-1.exo.io/exoscale-academy/videos/csa-networks-03.mp4)

## Load Balancing

### Load Balancing

Exoscale enriches app reliability with flexible load balancing and elastic IPs, supporting secure, automated port or IP routing, health checks, and fine-grained traffic distribution for seamless cloud performance and high availability.

### Network Load Balancer

* Highly available and performant Layer 4 (TCP/UDP) load balancing for Instance Pools  
* Routes traffic only to healthy pool members, based on configurable health checks  
* Preserves the source IP of client requests  
* For public access, configure Ingress Rules for the target port and health checks in the Instance Pool’s Security Group  
* To restrict access, allow only specific subnets or security groups to reach the target port, and set up health check rules for public sources  
* Health check status is accessible via API

#### Routing Strategies
* Round-Robin - Evenly distributes traffic across all pool members. 
* Source-Hash - Consistently routes traffic from the same source address to the same instance.

![](nlb.png "Network Load Balancer")


### Managed Elastic IP

* Forwards traffic to a single instance or distributes it across multiple instances  
* Traffic distribution may not be even  
* No configuration required on target instances  
* Forwards traffic on all ports  
* Health checks are performed, but not visible to users  
* To ensure reachability, open the relevant ports for the Elastic IP  

> __! NOTE__
This cannot be used for outgoing traffic.

![](m-eip.png "Managed Elastic IP")


### Comparison - Network Load Balancer vs Managed Elastic IP

![](nlb-icon.png "")
__Network Load Balancer__

* Routes traffic to Instance Pools  
* Distributes traffic evenly across pool members  
* Supports routing of individual ports and services  
* Health check status is observable

![](m-eip-icon.png "")
__Managed Elastic IP__

* Routes traffic to individual Instances
* Does not guarantee even traffic distribution  
* Forwards all ports on the assigned IP  
* Health checks are performed, but not observable


### Unmanaged Elastic IP

* Provides a simple failover IP address  
* Can be used as an outgoing IP via a loopback interface  
* Security Groups apply as usual
* Must be manually configured on the instance  


__cloud-init configuration__

```
#cloud-config
write_files:
  - path: /etc/netplan/51-eip.yaml
    content: |
      network:
        version: 2
        renderer: networkd
        ethernets:
        lo:

            name: lo
          addresses:
            - 159.100.241.235/32
runcmd:
  - [ netplan, apply ]
```

### Security Groups

* Define and combine firewall rules for flexible network security  
* Functions like VLANs, providing network segmentation  
* Block incoming traffic by default; Allow outgoing traffic by default  
* Optionally block all internet traffic for private instances  
* Specify source addresses as subnets, other Security Groups, or Public Security Groups

![](sec-groups.png "Security Groups Overview")

#### Security Groups Examples

![](sec-groups-1.png "Security Group Examples")

__Frontend Security Group__

* Allow inbound traffic from `0.0.0.0/0` on port `80/tcp` (HTTP)
* Allow inbound traffic from `0.0.0.0/0` on port `443/tcp` (HTTPS)
* Allow inbound traffic from `90.80.60.0/24` on port `22/tcp` (SSH)`*` 

`*` ... Allows SSH access only for clients from the specified subnet (e.g., company network)

__Backend Security Group__ 

* Allow traffic from the Frontend Security Group on port `8080/tcp`
* Allow traffic from the Backend Security Group on port `8080/tcp` `*`

`*`... Enables backend instances to communicate with each other on port `8080`

## Cloud Challenges

### Cloud Challenges

Exoscale highlights key cloud challenges—like unique legacy setups, oversized resources, backup complexity, migration hurdles, network limits, and licensing pitfalls—helping you build resilient, future-ready cloud architectures.

#### Special Snowflake
* Single, manually installed server with no documentation  
* Hard-coded IP addresses or credentials across systems  
* IP addresses may not be transferable to the cloud  
* Migration requires a planned downtime and a rollback strategy

#### Huge Instance
* Requests for very large resources (e.g., 512 GB RAM, >15 TB disk, or a small CPU with a large disk)  
* Often impractical or costly in the cloud, especially for databases  
* May not be supported by cloud providers

#### Migration
* Options include file transfer (e.g., rsync), backup tools, or converting images (e.g., VMware to QCOW2)
* Advanced migrations require custom templates and careful management
* Templates cannot be deleted while instances are booted from them

#### Network Throughput
* No cloud provider guarantees bandwidth or latency between VMs  
* On-premises SLAs are easier to achieve with dedicated infrastructure  
* Cloud services should be designed for smaller, fault-tolerant deployments

#### Licensing
* Some software licenses are not cloud-friendly  
* Licensing may require coverage for all possible CPU cores
* Support may be limited to certified hypervisors only

#### Backup
* On-premises backups often use full VM images, which are inefficient and expensive in the cloud 
* Cloud backups should be re-tooled for software-level recovery
