title: Solution - Nodes
---

1. Create a Deployment named *web-app* with 6 replicas using nginx:1.26 image

```bash
kubectl create deployment web-app --image=nginx:1.26 --replicas=6
```

2. Create a DaemonSet named *monitoring* using nginx:alpine image

```bash
kubectl create -f - <<EOF
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  name: monitoring
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: monitoring
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: monitoring
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: monitoring
        image: nginx:alpine
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
EOF
```

3. Check how Pods are distributed across all Nodes

```bash
kubectl get pods -o wide
```

You should see Pods are distributed across worker Nodes, and one monitoring Pod per Node.

4. You need to perform maintenance on worker1. First, `cordon`this Node to prevent new Pods from being scheduled on it

```bash
kubectl cordon worker1
```

5. Verify that worker1 is cordoned, but existing Pods are still running

- worker1 should show as Ready,SchedulingDisabled

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

- existing Pods on worker1 should still be running

```bash
kubectl get pods -o wide
```

6. Drain worker1 to move all Pods to other nodes

```bash
kubectl drain worker1 --ignore-daemonsets --delete-emptydir-data --force
```

{{< hextra/callout type="warning" >}}
- `--ignore-daemonsets` flag is needed because DaemonSet Pods cannot be moved
- `--delete-emptydir-data` flag ensures that Pods with emptydir volumes can be deleted
- `--force` flag ensures Pods that are not managed by a controller can be destroyed
{{< /hextra/callout >}}

7. Verify all web-app Pods have been moved out of worker1, while DaemonSet Pods are still running

```bash
kubectl get pods -o wide
```

8. Make worker1 available for scheduling again

```bash
kubectl uncordon worker1
```

9. Force the restart of the web-app deployment and verify some Pods are scheduled on worker1

```bash
kubectl rollout restart deployment/web-app
kubectl get pods -o wide
```

You should notice that some Pods are scheduled on worker1.

10. Clean up all resources

```bash
kubectl delete deployment web-app
kubectl delete daemonset monitoring
```
