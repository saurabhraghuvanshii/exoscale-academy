title: Solution - Ch3
---

1. Test

Let's create a new Pod and expose it with a ClusterIP Service

```bash
kubectl run nginx --image=nginx:1.20 --port 80 --expose
```

Let's new get an interactive shell in an Alpine based Pod

```bash
kubectl run -ti --rm debug --image=alpine -- sh
```

We cannot reach the nginx Pod from the debug one:

```bash
/ # wget http://nginx
wget: bad address 'nginx'
```

Going one step further we can see the name resolution is not working fine:

```bash
/ # nslookup nginx
;; connection timed out; no servers could be reached
```

2. Checking the cluster's internal DNS

```bash
kubectl get deploy -n kube-system
NAME             READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
coredns          0/0     0            0           2d17h
```

Seems like there is no replica running for the dns (should be 2 by default)

3. Fixing the thing

Let's increase the number of replicas to 2

```bash
kubectl -n kube-system scale deploy/coredns --replicas=2
```

4. Verification

The name resolution is now working:

```bash
Server:		10.96.0.10
Address:	10.96.0.10:53
Name:	nginx.default.svc.cluster.local
Address: 10.96.188.129
...
```

From a new debug Pod the nginx Pod can be reached:

```bash
/ # wget -O- nginx
Connecting to nginx (10.96.188.129:80)
