Observe the behavior of the pod you will notice the pod is automatically restarted after a few tens of seconds:

```bash
$ kubectl get po -w
NAME   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
demo   1/1     Running   0          2s
demo   1/1     Running   1 (1s ago)   76s
```

Going a little deeper in the details, we understand this is due to the liveness probe failing:

```bash
$ kubectl describe po demo
...
Events:

  Normal   Killing    8s (x2 over 83s)    kubelet            Container busybox failed liveness probe, will be restarted
```

If we check the pod's specification, we can see the liveness probe checks the existence of a file:

```bash
$ kubectl get po demo -o yaml
...
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: demo
  ...
spec:
  containers:
  - args:
    - /bin/sh
    - -c
    - touch /tmp/healthy; sleep 30; rm -rf /tmp/healthy; sleep 600
    image: k8s.gcr.io/busybox
    imagePullPolicy: Always
    livenessProbe:
      exec:
        command:
        - cat
        - /tmp/healthy
      failureThreshold: 3
      initialDelaySeconds: 5
      periodSeconds: 5
      successThreshold: 1
      timeoutSeconds: 1
```

The */tmp/healthy* file is removed after 30 seconds. According to the liveness probe's specification, 15 seconds after the file is removed the container is considered unhealthy and is restarted.

We can change the command *sleep 30* into *sleep 120* to have an healthy container for a longer period.

First we get the pod specification

```bash
kubectl get po demo -o yaml > demo-pod.yaml
```

Next we change the command:

```bash
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: demo
  ...
spec:
  containers:
  - args:
    - /bin/sh
    - -c
    - touch /tmp/healthy; sleep 120; rm -rf /tmp/healthy; sleep 600        # <- change done here
    image: k8s.gcr.io/busybox
    imagePullPolicy: Always
    livenessProbe:
      exec:
        command:
        - cat
        - /tmp/healthy
      failureThreshold: 3
      initialDelaySeconds: 5
      periodSeconds: 5
      successThreshold: 1
      timeoutSeconds: 1
    ...
```

Then we replace the existing pod:

```bash
cat demo-pod.yaml | kubectl replace --force -f -
pod "demo" deleted
pod/demo replaced
```

The pod should remain healthy for a longer period (more than 2 minutes):

```bash
kubectl get po demo -w
NAME   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
demo   1/1     Running   0          6s
demo   1/1     Running   1 (1s ago) 2m46s
```
