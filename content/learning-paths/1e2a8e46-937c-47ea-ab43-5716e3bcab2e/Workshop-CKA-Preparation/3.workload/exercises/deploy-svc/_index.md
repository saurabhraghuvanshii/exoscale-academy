---

## Exercise

1. Create a Deployment with 5 replicas of Pods based on the *nginx:1.20-alpine* image

2. Scale the Deployment to 3 replicas

3. Expose the Pods using a Service of type NodePort

4. Get the opened port and try to access the application from a node

5. Delete the Deployment and Service

## Solution

1. Create a Deployment with 5 replicas of Pods based on the *nginx:1.20-alpine* image

```
kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx:1.20-alpine --replicas=5
```

2. Scale the Deployment to 3 replicas

```
kubectl scale deploy/nginx --replicas=3
```

3. Expose the Pods using a Service of type NodePort

```
kubectl expose deploy/nginx --type=NodePort --port 80
```

4. Get the opened port and try to access the application from a node

```
k get svc nginx
NAME    TYPE       CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
nginx   NodePort   10.101.92.175   <none>        80:31641/TCP   15s
```

In this example the opened port is 31641.

From a shell on a node:

```
curl http://localhost:31641

```
